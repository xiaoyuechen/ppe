% Answers about add benchmark
\subsection{Why were all benchmark runs not the same speed in 1 and 2?}

\subsection{What was the problem with 1 and 2 that we fixed in 3?}

\subsection{What optimization did the compiler do for 1 that prevented us from measuring what we wanted?}

\subsection{What did the code change in 2 do to prevent the compiler from doing this optimization?}

\subsection{What optimization did the compiler do for 3 that prevented us from measuring what we wanted?}

\subsection{Why was the performance of 4 so much slower than 2?}

\subsection{What was the optimization in 6 and why does it improve performance?}
