\section{Optimizing motionVectorSearch}

Originally takes 95.22\% of runtime using 4K image sizes. This equals around  seconds per frame.
We determined that the bottleneck is the code that compares the block to all other possible blocks in the window in order to find the best possible match for where that block moved to.
We decided to use the GPU to speed up this comparison, and we used the map-reduce algorithm to divide the work amongst GPU cores, collect the results, and reduce the results to find the best match.
